# Pok√©mon Super Gold 97

This page is the source for Pokemon Super Gold 97, a game which intends to serve as a "completed" version of the 1997 Pokemon Gold and Silver Spaceworld Demo.

Intro
- With the release of the Spaceworld 97 demo, I was inspired to create a game that would represent what I felt like a "finished" version of that demo could look like. How would the game turned out if it continued on the path that was shown at that event? Well, that's what I set out to create, and what you can find here!

Story
- You are a new trainer who sets out on a journey to help Professor Oak with researching Pokemon, very much like the very first games. This story is built on the foundation that was pulled from the demo itself, and has you traverse Nihon, based on the entirety of Japan, while you collect badges and catch Pokemon. You'll also have to face off against Team Rocket, who are building a machine that would give them incredible power over Pokemon! Silver is portrayed in the manner that he was in the demo - not as an antagonist, but as an energetic rival, kind of similar to gen 4's Barry. The story is admittedly kind of simple, but intentionally so. It was written to feel like the story that might have been in the demo had it been completed.

New! Full-length Player's Guidebook!
- Join the Discord Server for Super Gold 97 to obtain access to a 300-page PDF containing a full walkthrough, Pokedex, and all sorts of information about Super Gold 97! As well as to just chat about the game and anything related to it!

Features
- Graphics fully pulled from the Spaceworld demo, complete with Pokemon sprites, overworld tilesets, trainer sprites, etc, along with a handful of sprites I had to redesign myself to better match the art style of the demo
- Interface elements such as Pokedex, status screen, etc have been redesigned to appear similar to the demo
- Pikachu minigame! (press Left +B on title screen and wait for music to end)
- 251 Pokemon, the complete Pokedex as it appeared in the demo. The main way that this differs from what would have been in an "official" game is that all 251 Pokemon are obtainable in one save file
- New key items that match the story presented in the game
- Evolutionary stones that match the Demo (Heart Stone, Poison Stone) as well as an additional Covenant Orb that allows for the evolution of Pokemon that would normally require trading
- New in-game status booster held items, pulled from the demo
- 8 badges, Pokemon League, a full length game
- A new original postgame map not present in the Spaceworld demo
- Type chart inspired by the demo
- Full support for the original Game Boy
- Full support for the Super Game Boy
- Full support for the Game Boy Color (with two different color modes)
- Improved level curve compared to final Gold and levels are generally higher, leading to a slightly tougher game but still not overly difficult
- Additional rematches for Gym Leaders and Pokemon League
- Skateboard!
- Additional moves based on scrapped moves from the demo
- Several Beta music tracks
- Expanded bedroom decoration system
